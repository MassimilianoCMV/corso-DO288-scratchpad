# Red Hat Training Lab Grading Infrastructure

## Lab Grading Framework

### Purpose
This framework provides the lab grading infrastructure
for Red Hat Training courseware. The tools in this library
allow the student to grade the progress of their lab work
in their classroom lab environment.

### How to develop lab scripts?

Start learning your way around the framework with the [Lab Grading Framework Training](docs/training/README.adoc).

If you are already familiar with the framework, please read the [development guide](docs/development/README.adoc).

If you are releasing a new version, then read the [publish guide](docs/development/PUBLISH.adoc).

#### Scaffolding

The `lab-generator` tool can create the lab package and lab scripts.

##### Generating lab packages

To generate a lab package for a course execute the `lab-generator` tool with the `create-package` 
option, the course SKU as the first parameter and the path of thie course git repository as the
second parameter: 

```
$ PYTHONPATH=. ./infrastructure/development/lab-generator create-package DO370 /home/GLS/DO370
Creating directory: /home/GLS/DO370/classroom/grading
Creating labs package for DO360  
Lab package is located in the: /home/GLS/DO360/classroom/grading directory
```

##### Generating lab scripts

Once a lab package has ben generated in the course git repository, use the `lab-generator` tool
with the `add-script` option with the SKU, git repository and script name as mandatory parameters.
The `--template` option is not mandatory and defaults to `openshift`:

```
$ PYTHONPATH=. ./infrastructure/development/lab-generator add-script AD240 ../AD240 --template openshift install-setup
The new lab script is located at /home/GLS/DO370/classroom/grading/src/do370/install-setup.py
```
